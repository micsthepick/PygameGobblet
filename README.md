# PygameGobblet
A single computer pygame/pythonista implementation of the two player board game "gobblet"

## How to play:

Move pieces by clicking on them. A piece will follow the mouse if selected. One of your own goblets may be placed on an empty space on the board, and any goblet can be placed over the top of a larger goblet. The goal is to get four of your goblets in a row (all must be exposed) exposing the last goblet of four in a row for the opponent will result in your loss, unless you are able to also form four in a row of your own at the same move, which would result in a tie. Alternatively you could cover another of the four pieces to prolong gameplay if possible.

Once a game is finished, you may press r to start a new game. At any time, press esc or press the red button to quit the game

## notice:
the pygame version does not have a win detector!
